# Day 1
## 30th of july 2025

My first day at GNDEC started with all the ece,ee,me,ce and AR students . firstly when we come in college, we go for gurudwara. Where already path is started. Then kirtan is sing. After that we pray to God for our four years journey. Then Amrit parshad is surved. 

Next, we all headed to the auditorium for the inaugural ceremony. The event was hosted by Tarnveer Kaur, who kept the flow going smoothly. Harsimran ma'am then gave us a short but informative talk about the college’s background and achievements over the years. One of the former professors also spoke and shared some really thoughtful quotes that left a mark on many of us.

The chief guest, Mahesh Inder Singh, gave a heartfelt speech. He shared some personal memories related to the college and even mentioned his older brother who had completed his B.Tech from here. Our principal then addressed us, speaking with a lot of warmth and encouraging us to make the most of our time here. He emphasized the importance of feeling at home in a new place, which was comforting to hear.

After a short break, we were guided to our respective departments based on our chosen branches. It was great to see the campus more closely and meet some of the faculty. That marked the end of Day 1.

Today was my second day at college, and it was full of exciting events and insightful lectures. The day began with an expert lecture by Dr. Priya Darshani on universal human values. She emphasized how our efforts can lead to happiness and prosperity, distinguishing between physical facilities and true understanding.

Then came a pleasant surprise—a presentation about the Satya Scholarship. It was great to learn about the opportunity, and they guided us step-by-step on how to register for it. It's exciting to see such support for students right from the start.

Next up was Dr. Arvind Dhingra, the director of STEP and in-charge of TAC, who delivered an inspiring lecture. He shared valuable insights and advice, which left a lasting impression on us all.

After a short break, we had two subject tests—one in English and another in Maths. It was a bit challenging, but a good way to assess our understanding early on. The day wrapped up with a sense of accomplishment and anticipation for what's to come in this journey at college.

The third day of college started with a session by the Causmic Club in the auditorium. We were told that this club was formed in 2025 mainly to organise various college events and activities. They also gave us a brief tutorial on how to create a GitHub account and how to upload our projects there, which was something new and interesting for many of us.

After that, we had another session on Human Resource Values by Dr. Priya Darshani ma'am. She continued from where she left off earlier, going deeper into the topic. While it was informative, the session was quite long, and to be honest, some students started feeling a little bored.

Post break, we had our first proper subject-wise lectures. The first one was English by Prof. Nisha. It was really engaging—everyone got a chance to introduce themselves, and she also explained a few grammar tips that are important for speaking confidently. It felt nice to have such an interactive class.

The final lecture of the day was a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) session, where our seniors taught us some basics of the C++ programming language. They even gave us code snippets to try out on our laptops using a compiler, which made the session hands-on and practical. And with that, our third day at college came to an end!

The fourth day at college began with an unexpected twist. As I arrived in the afternoon, buzzing with excitement for the day ahead, the schedule suddenly changed just before the first lecture in the auditorium. Amidst the confusion, each branch was directed to their respective allotted classrooms where our seniors awaited us eagerly. In our hour-long class session, we introduced ourselves one by one, breaking the ice and getting to know our peers. Our seniors enlightened us about various club activities and upcoming events, setting the tone for our college journey.

Later, we gathered again in the auditorium for a captivating lecture by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar on the wonders of millets as a superfood. The atmosphere was engaging, with Mrs. Makkar delving into the nutritional benefits of millets, emphasizing their protein content and sharing insights into their culinary history. Her interactive approach encouraged many students, including myself, to actively participate, making the lecture both informative and enjoyable.

The day concluded with a sense of camaraderie and newfound knowledge about millets, leaving us eager for more enriching experiences in the days to come. As a college fresher, each day brings new surprises and opportunities for learning, and I look forward to embracing all that this journey has to offer.

His session was not just informative but also interactive, with many fitness enthusiasts eagerly posing questions about protein intake, managing sugar levels, and understanding the psychology of fitness.

After a rejuvenating break, we transitioned to our first physics lecture conducted by Prof. Jaspreet Singh. He introduced us to the foundational aspects of physics and outlined the semester's syllabus, focusing particularly on the intriguing realm of electromagnetism, which will be our initial exploration. His explanation of key terminologies and concepts sparked our curiosity and set a promising tone for the semester ahead.

Later in the day, we attended a session on P2P (Peer-to-Peer) learning, where we received a comprehensive introduction to the basics of C++.

The sixth day of our college induction program began with subject-wise lectures, setting an academic tone for the day. Our first lecture was by Prof. Jaspreet Singh, our Physics teacher, who introduced us to the concept of partial differentiation. He explained its use in solving problems and gave us a few practice questions as well. He also emphasized the importance of revising our Class 11 and 12 concepts, which would help us strengthen our foundation in Physics.

Next, we had our Mathematics lecture by Prof. Sandeep Kaur Gill. She informed us that the first unit of our semester would focus on differential equations. She began by asking questions to check our understanding from previous classes, and then, quite unexpectedly, asked about our Class 12 board exam marks in Maths. The session turned out to be quite productive, as she not only clarified previously learned concepts but also introduced us to some new meanings and perspectives in mathematics.

After a short break, we all headed to the auditorium for an enlightening session by Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana, the incharge of the Central Multifacilitated Learning department. He introduced us to various online programs related to soft skills and personality development. What really amazed us was the mention of some premium study courses, including those associated with IITs, being available for free or minimal charges. The lecture gave us a whole new outlook on self-improvement opportunities available to us beyond the classroom.

The final session of the day was delivered by Dr. Jasvir Singh Grewal, the incharge of NSS (National Service Scheme). He spoke about how the NSS plays a vital role in shaping responsible and mature citizens. He shared the core values and goals of the organization and encouraged us to participate actively in social service. To wrap up the day on a lighter note, a short comedy act was organized, which brought smiles and laughter to everyone's faces—ending our day on a cheerful and positive note.
